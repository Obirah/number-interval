# number-interval
This is a NPM library that provides a simple numeric interval with arithmetic operations.

## Less talk, more library
`npm install number-interval`

Keep track of the versions with the [changelog](https://github.com/Obirah/number-interval/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Motivation
Initially this code was written in order to compute CIDRs in [this project](https://github.com/Obirah/cidr-deny-allow-transformer).

As it can be used for other interval computations as well (for example time intervals), I decided to
put it into a separate library.

## Usage
Check out the [unit test](https://github.com/Obirah/number-interval/blob/master/test/number-interval.spec.ts)
in order to see all operations in use with some example values.
